#In this program, after defining the two variables, fruit and index, we make a loop where if the lenght of a variable is lower than 0, which is always the case
#Then a new variable is the bracketed first letter, the zeroth of the variable. Print that letter and then proceed by adding 1 to the the bracketed position.
#The result is to print its of the variable's letters one by one.
